## Matheus Muniz

My name is Matheus.
I am currently 16 years old.

I am passionate about the way the world is moved to programming.
I am a great admirer in the area of web development, programming and information security.
Nowadays I always try to improve my knowledge in some languages and in
qualifying my skills in certain areas.

I aim to become an ethical hacker while I don't go to college.
The college I dream of graduating is in the profession of Veterinary Doctor and power
use the programming knowledge that I have today and that in the future I will acquire
to improve the quality of life and health of animals in general.

Below is some curious information about me on the schedule.
I hope you like it and maybe you will learn something with the knowledge I currently have.
